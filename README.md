# Text-Summarization
In this project, we are building a webapp using the research paper Sequence Generative Adversarial Network for Text Summarization. The webapp can be used for abstractive summarization task of text (i.e., Document summarization, Web page summarization). Abstractive summarization reproduces important material in a new way after interpretation and examination of the text using advanced natural language processing techniques.In this project, we are building a webapp using the research paper History Reuse and Bag-of-Words Loss for Long Summary Generation. The webapp can be used for abstractive summarization task of text (i.e., Document summarization, Web page summarization) and will be used for effective long text summary generation. This paper concentrates on two prominent problems in long summary generation. First, although significant efforts have been made to assist the encoder in handling long sequences, the decoder struggles with long sequences owing to the limited storage capacity of RNN. It proposes a simple and effective approach called history reuse,
